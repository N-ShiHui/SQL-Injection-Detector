# Using Random Forest Classifier to Detect SQL Injection Attack
### This project focuses on the use of a machine learning technique, Random Forest Classifier, to detect SQL injection attack.
* Data used is a clean input based off a small list of SQL queries.
* Download files and save them in one directory.
* To run the model and fastapi app, simply kickstart the fastapi app in main.py
